- **Hardware Requirements**: Identified VCC, GND, TX, RX pin connections
- **Software Requirements**: Serial communication through SoftwareSerial library
- **Backward Compatibility**: Planning to maintain existing serial commands

## BLE Integration Complete ✅

### Implementation Summary
- **Hardware Documentation**: Complete wiring diagrams and connection guide
- **Arduino Integration**: BLE-enabled sketch with HM-10 configuration
- **Python Testing**: Cross-platform BLE test script with bleak library
- **Dual Interface**: Maintains USB serial compatibility alongside BLE
- **Mobile Testing**: Support for smartphone BLE scanner apps

### Integration Steps Completed ✅

- **Command Protocol**: All existing buzzer commands work via BLE ("BEEP", "HELLO", etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Robust error checking and dual-interface support
- **Configuration**: Automatic HM-10 setup with custom device name and UUIDs

### Testing & Validation
- **Computer Testing**: Python script ready for BLE scanning and command transmission
- **Mobile Testing**: Compatible with standard BLE scanner apps
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Comprehensive FAQ and diagnostic procedures
- **Performance Metrics**: Documented latency and resource usage comparisons

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices
- **HM-10 vs ESP32**: HM-10 chosen for simpler Arduino integration vs ESP32's WiFi complexity
- **SoftwareSerial vs Hardware Serial**: SoftwareSerial for BLE to keep debug serial available
- **BLE GATT Profile**: Custom service for buzzer control instead of standard serial service

### Current Constraints
- **Arduino Memory**: HM-10 library and BLE stack will consume additional RAM
- **Pin Usage**: SoftwareSerial needs 2 dedicated pins for communication
- **BLE Range**: 10-20 meter range limitation vs USB cabling
- **Power Requirements**: HM-10 needs 3.3V-6V power supply

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### BLE Integration Patterns
- **AT Command Configuration**: HM-10 setup using serial AT commands during initialization
- **Data Reception**: Polling approach with `available()` checks
- **Command Parsing**: Same string parsing logic as serial version
- **Response Transmission**: BLE characteristics for feedback messages

### Hardware Connection Strategy
- **Power Supply**: Direct from Arduino 5V pin (HM-10 regulates to 3.3V)
- **Serial Pins**: Arduino pins 10(RX)/11(TX) connected to HM-10 TX/RX
- **State Pin**: Optional HM-10 STATE pin monitoring for connection status
- **Baud Rate**: HM-10 defaults to 9600 baud for compatibility

## Project Insights & Learnings

### BLE Implementation Considerations
- **Library Dependencies**: May need additional BLE libraries beyond Arduino core
- **Power Management**: BLE advertising consumes more power than wired serial
- **Security**: BLE custom service provides basic security through pairing
- **Debugging Challenges**: BLE issues harder to diagnose than wired serial

### Modification Strategy
- **Incremental Changes**: Start with basic BLE echo, then add buzzer commands
- **Dual Interface**: Maintain USB serial for development, add BLE for production
- **Code Organization**: Separate BLE logic from core buzzer functionality
- **Testing Approach**: USB serial first, then BLE communication validation
