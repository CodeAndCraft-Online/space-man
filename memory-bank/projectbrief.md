# Arduino Buzzer Control Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a serial-controlled buzzer system for Arduino Uno R3, allowing Python scripts to trigger musical tones and sequences via serial communication on COM6.

## Core Requirements
- **Hardware Control**: Buzzer connected to pin 9 on Arduino Uno
- **Serial Communication**: 9600 baud rate communication between Arduino and Python
- **Tone Generation**: Use Arduino `tone()` function for musical frequencies instead of basic `digitalWrite()` buzz
- **Command System**: Simple text-based commands (BEEP, BEEP_ON, BEEP_OFF, HELLO)

## Success Criteria
- Arduino sketch successfully compiles and uploads to Arduino Uno
- Python script can connect to COM6 and send commands
- Buzzer produces clear, musical tones with "ba dum tss" sequence
- System is extensible for additional notes/frequencies
- Code is well-documented and maintainable

## Project Scope
- Single buzzer control (expandable to multiple buzzers)
- Serial communication protocol
- Basic musical sequence generation
- Error handling and feedback via serial

## Technical Foundation
- Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller
- Python serial communication with pySerial
- Arduino CLI compilation and upload
- Tone generation using Arduino's tone() function
